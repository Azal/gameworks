Gameworks (Games + Framework)
=============================

## Introduction

The Gameworks framework allows you to create java game applications in a quick and easy way. The main target is the creation of 2D games, with the focus on RPG genre. It provides a lot of classes and functions, which makes it easy for starter java programmers to develop awesome game projects from scratch.
This project will finally be available as an Eclipse plug-in. More to come.

### Installation

To clone the project start with:

	git clone https://github.com/maxfindel/gameworks

If you don't have permission to write, send an email to the owner([max@findel.cl](mailto:max@findel.cl)).  
Then start an Eclipse Java Project with this folder as root and you are good to go.

The first thing you need to do once you cloned the project is:

	cd gameworks
	cp ./pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
This will prevent casual pushes to the **master** branch. 

Now, go to your groups branch with:

	git checkout groupX/master

***Always*** pull changes before doing any work:

	git pull origin groupX/master
	git pull origin master
	/* If there are any changes or updates you want to push: */
	git push origin groupX/master
